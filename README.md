The Task
On the page there is the article, text fields – “username” and “comment” and the button “send”.
-	As a user I should have a possibility to comment the article.
-	As a user I should have a possibility to reply on comments of other users.
Comment should contain the following info:
-	Username;
-	Date of the comment.
-	Button “reply”
When I click “reply” button, I expect the field “comment” and button “send” appears. (The form should be hidden and displayed in the comment section after click on “reply” button using jQuery)
All comments and replies should be displayed as a tree.
-	The task must be implemented by using ASP.NET Web Forms/MVC. Source code must be stored on GitHub.
